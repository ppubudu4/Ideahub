                            <p>As soon as I completed my A/L in Biology stream I joined NIBM to read for BSc in Management Information System (Special) degree . Specialty of the MIS degree is, it is a combination of Information Technology, Management, Information Systems, and Networking etc.  Third year at my university life was remarkable because I got an opportunity to work at SLT- Head Office as an Intern. My career as a System /Network Engineer started from there .I got this opportunity because of NSBM.

The other specialty in this degree program is that I got an opportunity to work while I am studying. So it was a great opportunity because we were one step higher from our other university students as we were able to do our academics and gain working experience at the same time before even graduating.

If I mention about our lecture panel, most of them were industry experienced professionals who not only taught us theories, but they do share their experience at previous working environments which made us strong. With their guidance and my parents support I was able to get a First Class honors. Since I started working from 3rd year at NSBM, I had one and half years of working experience additional to my academic achievements at the time I got graduated. From my childhood I had a passion for Network Security and NSBM became one of the key points in my life which helped me to be where I am today. Currently I am working for Virtusa as an Engineer - Specialized. Day by day I am going towards my goal now. And I would like to say that it happened like this because of everyone&#039;s help. When you chose the right decision at the right time things are going to work as never before.</p>

                            <p>After A/Levels I was wandering what would be my future goals and whom I would become. In the mean time my loving family directed me to Information Technology which was an emerging industry in Sri Lanka. So in 2010, I joined National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) with the intention of becoming an IT professional.

With the knowledge gained in the classroom for almost 2 years, I was privileged to undergo an industrial training which was set as one of my leaning objectives at National School of Business Management (NSBM) and actually that 6 months were the triggering point of me choosing the Quality Assurance career path which lead myself today to become a Software Quality Assurance Analyst at MillenniumIT Software (Private) Limited at Malabe.

It was 4 years totaling in my undergraduate life and last 2 years of them I already knew clearly what my goals were and whom I would become once graduated. Today, I am a graduate of BSc in Management Information Systems (Special) with second class upper grade and have achieved my career goal as well. I am a proud son to my loving family and I am grateful for them as well as all the lecturers and all the members who helped me directly or indirectly at NIBM/NSBM.</p>

                            <p>After A/L examination I chose to study at The National School of Business Management because it offers the unique combination of Information technology and Management in one programme which helped me to fulfill my ambition as a Software Engineer. This bachelor degree has given me insight into these two extremely influential parts of modern-day society and the ways in which they complement each other, specifically in a business environment. I enjoy being a student at NSBM for two main reasons. First, I have experienced that communicating every day with people with different cultural backgrounds can be quite challenging &ndash; for example, minding cultural differences, religious preferences and values and keeping an open mind are some of the important things an international environment can teach a person. The programme IT &amp; Management stresses a lot the importance of team-work as in today&rsquo;s global environment, working in teams is a key skill. The second reason why I like this programme is related to the lecturers. All of them are really helpful people who enjoy teaching and being challenged by their students and their fresh ideas.

I started a Software company (Techsolit Software Solutions) in my 1st year with two of my colleagues and we have gained a lot experience as Entrepreneurs in real Business environment. I would like to give opportunities to other colleagues in future. I&rsquo;m really happy with my career and it is so helpful to achieve my future goal.
All in all, I recommend this programme to people who would like to develop their interpersonal skills, as well as feel challenged intellectually by the unique mixture of IT &amp; Management.</p>

                            <p>I joined NIBM for the BSc in MIS - Special (UGC approved) Degree in their first batch intake as for the recommendation of some previous students I knew. After completing first two years of the degree at NIBM, we were transferred to National School of Business Management (NSBM), which was established as the Degree School of NIBM, to complete the final two years. NSBM is one of the most recognized private sector Universities in Sri Lanka and is approved by the UGC of Sri Lanka.

The environment at NSBM was fabulous. The venue was in the center of Colombo which was convenient in travelling, even after evening lectures. And also all the required educational facilities such as study areas, library, computer labs and student consultation were excellent. Also the additional facilities such as cafeteria and student car park were really convenient for us while attending the lectures. And also our convocation, which was the most awaited day, was held in a grand manner.

Also I think the BSc in MIS &ndash; Special (UGC Approved) degree which I followed was an excellent choice and helped me to reach up to the position which I am in today. The industrial training period which was followed on behalf of the degree program helped me a lot in building up my professional life by giving industrial skills which are required for one to achieve a good future in career.
Currently, I am successfully employed as a Technical Writer at Eutech Cybernetic Pvt Ltd, Sri Lanka, which pioneers in introducing the Smart Building concept to the world with its&rsquo; iVivaCloud solution. I am really satisfied about my current position in the company.

My gratitude goes to all the lecturers, especially Mrs. Krishani (Dean &ndash; School of Computer Science, NSBM) and staff at NIBM and NSBM for guiding me throughout the years to achieve success.</p>

Choosing NSBM for higher studies was possibly one of the best decisions of my life. The skills I acquired at NSBM were extremely beneficial, not only for achieving my desired degree results but also when put in to practice at third level. I am so grateful to say that NSBM lead me towards achieving the next higher level as a graduate researcher in the field of Computer Science.
The opportunities we got at NSBM to engage with world-class academics with strong, credible industry links and to participate in effective team-based approach to project work were absolutely remarkable. The lecturers and staff were very supportive and ensured students gained sufficient hands on experience to take up any industry level project.
We also made good use of the library to broaden our knowledge with the help of thousands of relevant study materials. My friends and I often gathered in the modern study area which was so comfortable and gave the homely feeling. Taking part in various events which were organized time to time made life more enjoyable while also helping me to make new friends.
The memories and the experiences NSBM gave me were amazing. I highly recommend NSBM as the ideal choice for those who aspire to pursue higher studies in Computer Science and I wish NSBM good luck for ongoing success

When considering undergraduate studies in Information Technology, NSBM is difficult to miss. I believe most students are attracted to the reputation NSBM rightfully holds, its location in the financial capital of the country, and the strength of its government affiliation. The bachelor&rsquo;s program is exemplary on its own, with a comprehensive curriculum and boasting  strong focus on software programming - which is regarded highly both for future endeavors in academia as well as the labor market.            
My experience at NSBM fulfilled all these expectations and beyond. NSBM has a unique structure that I believe fosters independence and self-accountability. Through this, I was able to engage in many social events in a very fulfilling manner. I also fondly recall my experience as a batch representative, which allowed me to work with my batch mates and administrative staff as well as improve my leadership skills. Furthermore, the program left me with not only a tangible set of skills derived from the foreign lecturers from University College Dublin - Ireland, but also various organizational and time management skills which can only be developed in the right environment.
After completing my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science, I worked as software engineer in several well reputed IT companies in Sri Lanka. These experiences and the inspiration I gained from NSBM led me to entrepreneurship. Making the choice to follow a degree program in Computer Science at NSBM was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Today I am delighted because it gives me hope and confidence to go ahead in my career and face challenges in my life as well.

Organizations are rapidly rebuilding their key business processes based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to gain and sustain competitive advantage. Adapting ICT at workplace is an essential requirement in today&rsquo;s fast changing business climate. As a manager in ICT sector, changes and concepts need to be clearly understood to produce better results for my organization, which is Colombo Dockyard PLC - CDPLC. I completely deployed my educational knowledge and academic experience which were obtained during my undergraduate period at National School of Business Management &ndash; NSBM, to create this cultural change in my organization. NSBM provided extremely high scale ICT education during my BSc and MSc graduation period to develop my knowledge and skills as an ICT professional according to international standards and practices. That professional background allowed me to setup ICT systems in CDPLC more effectively for creating information-driven cultural change. I was able to acquire new knowledge, methodologies, concepts and tactics which entirely changed my ICT working style, behavior and thinking. NSBM greatly inspired me to develop my ICT knowledge and managerial skills which are equally important to develop ICT systems especially in a heavily engineering industry like CDPLC

My education of Plymouth University along with National School of Business Management has allowed me to combine my creativity with my professional life and use it in a productive manner. Computer Security program runs for 3 years. And there are many exciting modules which enhance our capabilities as well as enthusiasm. It&rsquo;s been challenging because in 3rd year we have to undergo Industry training along with the lectures. Which tests our skills and patience to the limit. The constant interaction with the academic staff as well as the institutional resources significantly contributed to the fostering of my intellectual development. I enjoy the challenge and sense of accomplishment that come with each module. Meeting those challenges motivates me to succeed academically and broadens my horizons socially. In the long run the encounter with the foreign lecturers enlighten us as to how we should face the challenges not only locally but in the global village too. Thus on the verge of completion of my degree with the Plymouth University I take this opportunity to wish her good luck in her future endeavors.</p>
